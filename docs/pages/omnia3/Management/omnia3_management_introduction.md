## 1. Introduction

The Management area of the platform is where administrative tasks are performed, such as tenant and security management.

## 2. Tenant Management

A Tenant is the primary organizational level of the platform. You can think of a tenant as an instance of an application for a given company - for example, you might have an AnalogSound_ExpensesManagement and an AnalogSound_Purchases tenant, to separate those two applications. You could also have a CompanyB_ExpensesManagement tenant that represents the same application, but for a different company.

Tenants may be categorized as **production**, in which case they require fiscal information.

By accessing **_Tenants_** in the sidebar, you will have access to the tenant management screen.

Here you can **Add new** tenants, identifying their **Code** (shown in URLs), a human-readable **Name**, and their production information.

Upon creating a tenant, some security information will automatically be created:
- An Administration[TenantCode] role, with your current user added to it;
- A Tenant[TenantCode] policy, with a default permission of "ALL"; with the previous role associated.
- Inside the tenant, the default application roles and policies.

## 3. Roles and Policies

In the management section, it is possible to configure Roles and Policies. For more details on these, please see [the description of how authorization works](omnia3_authorization.html), as well as [the language definitions](omnia3_languages_sml.html).

For users to be able to perform administration operations on a given tenant, they must be in the automatically created Administration[TenantCode] role.

## 4. API Clients
To allow an external application to consume the API of the OMNIA Platform, it is required to register an **API Client**, to interact with our security mechanism (using OAuth).

By accessing **API Clients**, you will have access to the API Clients management screen.

Here you can **Add new** clients, identifying their Name.

Upon creating a client, the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* are automatically created. 

### 4.1. Get the API Client credentials
In the **API Clients** list, selecting one of the records will open a new window containing the required credentials to accessing the OMNIA API: the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret**.

### 4.2. Regenerate the Client Secret
If you need to regenerate the Client Secret for some reason (e.g. your private secret got shared publically accidentally), select one of the records in the list and, in the details window, select the option **Regenerate secret**.

This action will generate another Client Secret and, from now on, you will need to use the new Secret.


## 5. Connectors
To allow to establish a communication between the OMNIA Platform and a system in another machine, it is required to register a **Connector**.

By accessing **Connectors**, you will have access to the Connectors management screen.

Here you can **Add new** connectors, identifying their Code and Name.

Upon creating a connector, a new API Client and a new User for the connector will be automatically created.

### 5.1. Get the Connector's username
In the **Connectors** list, selecting one of the records will open a new window containing the **Client Username**.

### 5.2. Get the API Client credentials
In the **Connectors** list, selecting one of the records will open a new window containing the required credentials to accessing the OMNIA API: the **Client ID** and the **Client Secret**.
