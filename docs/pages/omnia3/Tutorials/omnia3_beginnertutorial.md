## 1. Introduction

OMNIA 3.0, a truly **Agile Low-Code Development** and operation of **Management Information Systems**' platform, welcomes you aboard to its continuous development process: the User Experience.

We do understand all your difficulties on how to build a **business management application** from ground zero. That's why **OMNIA** takes the pledge to **leverage and accelerate** the entire development process, providing a **simple**, **fast** and **responsive-by-default** platform.

It's now time to judge our premises. To that end, we've just created a simple and intuitive tutorial based on an Order Management's example, guiding you throughout the **short-time period** of deploying all your inputs into a **business application**.

**Start your 20-minute exercise on OMNIA Low-Code Development Platform!**

## 2. Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have created a OMNIA tenant, and are logged in as a user with modeling privileges to this tenant.

If you do not have a tenant yet, please follow the steps of the [Tenant Creation tutorial](https://docs.omnialowcode.com/omnia3_tenantcreation.html).

## 3. Modeling an application

1. Start by selecting the tenant where you are going to model, and you will be redirected to the modeling area.

2. Through the left side menu, access the option ***Agents / Add New*** on the top right side, and setting its *Name* as **Company**.

    ![Modeler_Create_Agent](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Agent.PNG)

3. Return to the ***Agents*** list and click on button ***Add new*** to add a new Agent. Set its *Name* as **Supplier**.

4. Through the left side menu, access the option ***Resources / Add new*** on the top right side, and setting its *Name* as **Product**.

5. Access the option ***Versioning / Builds*** and build the tenant by clicking the button ***Create new***.

6. On the right side of the top bar, click first button and select option ***Application***. You will now be redirected to the application area.

7. Create a new **Company**, by selecting the option ***Configurations / Company*** and defining its *Code* and *Name*.

    ![Application_Create_Company](/images/tutorials/beginner/Application-Create-Company.PNG)

8.  Follow the same process of the previous step to create a new **Supplier** and **Product**.

9. Go back to modeling area (***Modeler***) and create a new **Commitment** with *Name* set as ***GoodsPurchaseRequest***, **Product** as the resource to be exchanged, **Supplier** as provider agent and **Company** as receiver agent.

    ![Modeler_Create_Commitment](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Commitment.PNG)

10. Add a new attribute by clicking on button **Add new / Primitive**. Set its *Name* as **UnitPrice**, *Type* as ***Decimal***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*.

    ![Modeler_Create_Attribute](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Attribute.PNG)

11. Edit the attribute **_amount**, and check option *Is read only?*.

12. Click on tab ***Entity Behaviours*** and on button **Add new > Formula**. Set its *Name* as **CalculateAmount**, attribute as **_amount** and set as code to execute `return UnitPrice * _quantity;`.

13. Add a new document by selecting option ***Documents / Add new***. Set **PurchaseOrder**, as the document's *Name*;

14. Click on ***Attribute / Add new / Collection*** in **Document**. Set its *Name* as *OrderLines*, *Type* as **Commitment > GoodsPurchaseRequest**.

15. Perform a new Build (by accessing the button **Build & Deploy** on the top right corner of your modeling area).

16. Navigate to ***Application*** through the top bar menu, and create a **Serie** for the document you just created, by selecting the option **Series / PurchaseOrderSeries**.

17. Create a new **PurchaseOrder** by selecting the option ***Documents / PurchaseOrder***.

18. Go back to modeling area (by accessing top bar menu option ***Modeler***) and edit the **PurchaseOrder** document to simplify its interface. Add a new attribute by clicking on button **Add new**. Set its *Name* as **Company**, *Type* as ***Agent / Company***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*.

19. Add ***Attribute / Add new / Reference***. Set its *Name* as **Supplier**, *Type* as ***Agent / Supplier***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*. 

20. Navigate to tab *Entity Behaviours* and click the button ***Add new / After Change*** to add a new **After Change** Behaviour to fill **_provider** and **_receiver** attributes. Define ***SetCommitmentAgents*** as Name and paste the following code:

    ```C#
        OrderLines.ForEach(line => {
	           line._provider = Supplier;
	           line._receiver = Company;
        });
    ```

21. Go to your ***PurchaseOrder*** **Document** User Interface by accessing the respective tab, and reorganize them to simplify the interface. Remove the elements **Provider**, **Receiver**  and **Code** from **OrderLines** element. At last, remove **Code** attribute from Document.

22. Reorganize Rows and Columns, re-establishing the **size** and **position** of their elements:
  * ***Serie***: Row 1, Column 1 and Size 4; 
  * ***Number***: Row 1, Column 5 and Size 4; 
  * ***Date***: Row 1, Column 9 and Size 4; 
  * ***Company***: Row 2, Column 1 and Size 4;
  * ***Supplier***: Row 2, Column 5 and Size 4.

23. Go to application and validate interface changes by creating a new **PurchaseOrder** document. The interface should be equal to the one below:
