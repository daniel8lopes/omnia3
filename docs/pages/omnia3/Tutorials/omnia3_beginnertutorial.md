## 1. Introduction

OMNIA 3.0, a truly **Agile Development** and operation of **Management Information Systems**' platform, welcomes you aboard to its continuous development process: the User Experience.

We do understand all your difficulties on how to build a **business management application** from ground zero. That's why **OMNIA** takes the pledge to **leverage and accelerate** the entire development process, providing a **simple**, **fast** and **responsive-by-default** platform.

It's now time to judge our premises. To that end, we've just created a simple and intuitive tutorial based on an Order Management's example, guiding you throughout the **short-time period** of deploying all your inputs into a **business application**.

**Start your 20-minute exercise on OMNIA Platform V.3.0!**

## 2. Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have created a OMNIA tenant, and are logged in as a user with modeling privileges to this tenant.

If you do not have a tenant yet, please follow the steps of the [Tenant Creation tutorial](http://docs.numbersbelieve.com/omnia3_tenantcreation.html).

## 3. Modeling an application

1. Start by selecting the tenant where you are going to model, and you will be redirected to the modeling area.

    ![Modeler_Create_Agent](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Agent.PNG)

3. Return to the ***Agents*** list and click on button ***Add new*** to add a new Agent. Set its *Name* as **Supplier**.

4. Through the left side menu, access the option ***Resources / Add new*** on the top right side, and setting its *Name* as **Product**.

5. Access the option ***Versioning / Builds*** and build the tenant by clicking the button ***Create new***.

6. On the right side of the top bar, click first button and select option ***Application***. You will now be redirected to the application area.

7. Create a new **Company**, by selecting the option ***Configurations / Company*** and defining its *Code* and *Name*.

    ![Application_Create_Company](/images/tutorials/beginner/Application-Create-Company.PNG)

8.  Follow the same process of the previous step to create a new **Supplier** and **Product**.

9. Go back to modeling area (***Modeler***) and create a new **Commitment** with *Name* set as ***GoodsPurchaseRequest***, **Product** as the resource to be exchanged, **Supplier** as provider agent and **Company** as receiver agent.

    ![Modeler_Create_Commitment](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Commitment.PNG)

10. Add a new attribute by clicking on button **Add new / Primitive**. Set its *Name* as **UnitPrice**, *Type* as ***Decimal***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*.

    ![Modeler_Create_Attribute](/images/tutorials/beginner/Modeler-Create-Attribute.PNG)

11. Edit the attribute **_amount**, and check option *Is read only?*.

12. Click on tab ***Entity Behaviours*** and on button **Add new > Formula**. Set its *Name* as **CalculateAmount**, attribute as **_amount** and set as code to execute `return UnitPrice * _quantity;`.

13. Add a new document by selecting option ***Documents / Add new***. Set **PurchaseOrder** as the document's *Name*;

14. Click on ***Attribute / Add new*** in **Document**. Set its *Name* as *OrderLines*, *Type* as **Commitment > GoodsPurchaseRequest**.

15. Perform a new Build (by accessing the option **Versioning / Builds** and clicking on button **Create new**).

16. Navigate to ***Application*** through the top bar menu, and create a **Serie** for the document you just created, by selecting the option **Series / PurchaseOrderSeries**.

17. Create a new **PurchaseOrder** by selecting the option ***Documents / PurchaseOrder***.

18. Go back to modeling area (by accessing top bar menu option ***Modeler***) and edit the **PurchaseOrder** document to simplify its interface. Add a new attribute by clicking on button **Add new**. Set its *Name* as **Company**, *Type* as ***Agent / Company***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*.

19. Add ***Attribute / Add new***. Set its *Name* as **Supplier**, *Type* as ***Agent / Supplier***, and as required by checking option *Is required?*. 

20. Navigate to tab *Entity Behaviours* and click the button ***Add new / After Change*** to add a new **After Change** Behaviour to fill **_provider** and **_receiver** attributes. Define ***SetCommitmentAgents*** as Name and paste the following code:

    ```C#
        OrderLines.ForEach(line => {
	           line._provider = Supplier;
	           line._receiver = Company;
        });
    ```

21. Go to your ***PurchaseOrder*** **Document** User Interface by accessing the respective tab, and reorganize them to simplify the interface. Remove the elements **Provider**, **Receiver**  and **Code** from **OrderLines** element. At last, remove **Code** attribute from Document.

22. Reorganize Rows and Columns, re-establishing the **size** and **position** of their elements:
  * ***Serie***: Row 1, Column 1 and Size 4; 
  * ***Number***: Row 1, Column 5 and Size 4; 
  * ***Date***: Row 1, Column 9 and Size 4; 
  * ***Company***: Row 2, Column 1 and Size 4;
  * ***Supplier***: Row 2, Column 5 and Size 4.

23. Go to application and validate interface changes by creating a new **PurchaseOrder** document. The interface should be equal to the one below:
