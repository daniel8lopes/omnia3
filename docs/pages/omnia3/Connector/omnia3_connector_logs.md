## 1. Obtaining the logs
There are three different logs being produced when you run the connector: the connector itself's logs, the behaviour manager's, and the behaviour server's. To understand what these three different softwares do, please read [this page](omnia3_connector_introduction.html).

Each of them will output their logs into the log folder configured by the user, following the same logging logic as the rest of the platform: a file prefixed by the date, such as `20180606-behavioursserver.log`. These files will be automatically split when they become too large.

## 2. Analyzing the logs
To analyze these logs, we recommend using a tool such as Notepad++, due to their potentially large file size and contents.

By default, they will be present in the temporary folder of your system, under an "omnia" folder, i.e., `%temp%/omnia` on Windows.
